# SDL-Tetris
Tetris made in C++ using SDL2.

## About
I've always loved Tetris and I thought re-creating it would be a great way to learn SDL2 and get more experience in C++. Even though there are still features I'd like to add (see the list below), I'm very happy with the results and think that it feels mostly authentic to normal Tetris.

## Future goals:
- [ ] CMake
- [ ] Show proper piece colours after being set
- [ ] Display score
- [ ] Show next piece
- [ ] Piece queue (at least one of each piece every 7 drops)
- [ ] Dynamic drop rate
